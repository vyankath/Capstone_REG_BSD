# Problem Statement:- 
Rental bicycles have been introduced in numerous urban centers to elevate the convenience of mobility. Ensuring the timely availability and accessibility of these rental bikes is pivotal in minimizing wait times. Consequently, establishing a consistent inventory of rental bikes within the city emerges as a significant focal point. The key challenge lies in forecasting the requisite bike quantities for each hour to maintain a steady provision of rental bikes.

# The Data Set and Approach:-**

The dataset used for this project comes from a bike sharing company and contains information about bike rentals, dates, times, weather, holidays, and operational days.

The project followed these steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to fix missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

2. **Data Splitting**: The data was divided into training and testing sets. Training data trained the model, while test data evaluated it.

3. **Model Experimentation**: Various machine learning models and settings were tried out. These models were trained with the training data, and their performances were assessed.

4. **Performance Evaluation**: Model performance was measured using metrics like mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and R-squared. The best-performing model on the test set was chosen.

5. **Feature Importance**: The impact of individual features on model performance was studied. Factors like temperature, weather, and seasonal features emerged as crucial for predicting bike demand.

6. **Model Deployment**: The selected model was put into action to make real-time bike demand predictions. The model's accuracy and effectiveness were continually monitored.

In simpler terms, we used bike rental data to build a model that predicts demand. We cleaned the data, tested different models, and picked the best one. Important factors like weather and seasonality were considered, and the chosen model was deployed for real predictions.
