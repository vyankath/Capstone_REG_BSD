By enabling residents and visitors to rent bikes from diverse stations across the city and return them at any station, Bike Seoul offers a convenient and eco-friendly travel option. As demand for bike rentals in Seoul has risen in recent years, there is a growing need for more efficient bike sharing operations. Accurate prediction of bike demand becomes essential to optimize fleet management, ensure bike availability at high-demand spots, and minimize wastage and costs.\n","\n","The central objective of this initiative involves the development of a proficient machine learning model that can precisely forecast bike rental demands in Seoul. This prediction relies on historical data and pertinent variables such as weather conditions, time of day, and public holidays. The project employed regression analysis techniques to model the historical bike demand information. This involved training the model on a comprehensive dataset encompassing past bike rental details, along with correlated weather and temporal information. Evaluation metrics like mean squared error and r-squared values were used to assess and test the model's performance. The primary aim was to achieve a minimum accuracy of 85% in bike demand predictions, thereby empowering the city's bike sharing providers to streamline fleet operations, promptly adapt to demand fluctuations, and enhance overall responsiveness. \n","\n","Various regression algorithms were explored, including linear regression, random forest, decision tree, gradient boosting, and Xtreme gradient boosting. Rigorous techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation were applied to enhance the model's precision. Ultimately, the Xtreme gradient boosting algorithm emerged as the chosen approach due to its impressive accuracy rates of approximately 93% and 90% on training and test data respectively.\n","\n","This endeavor yielded not only invaluable insights into bike demand trends within Seoul but also showcased the pragmatic utility of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges. The implications of these findings could potentially extend to other cities with analogous bike sharing systems, thereby fostering enhanced services for bike users and more sustainable urban transportation systems."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"},"source":["# **GitHub Link -**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"},"source":["https://github.com/vyankath/Capstone_REG_BSD"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"},"source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DpeJGUA3kjGy"},"source":["Rental bicycles have been introduced in numerous urban centers to elevate the convenience of mobility.
